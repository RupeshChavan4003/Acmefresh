            Hydroponic farms offer a pathway towards a more sustainable food
            ethic that prioritizes the health of our food, bodies and
            environment without the heavy use of chemicals. Far from being a
            pipe-dream, hydroponic farming is already being rapidly integrated
            into current food networks. Ocado, a leading British online
            supermarket, recently announced its partnership with Priva and
            80-Acres, both leading participants in the vertical farm industry.
            This joint venture will allow Ocado to supply fresh, local and
            hydroponically-grown ingredients to its customers. Furthermore, as
            the industry becomes more competitive, more partnerships like this
            will help drive down the prices of hydroponically-grown produce and
            make hydroponic farms more competitive with conventional farms.
            While our global climate issue is multi-dimensional and a result of
            many different practices, reducing the impact from the agricultural
            industry will be a huge step forward. At the beginning of the 21st
            century, hydroponic farming had not yet been invented. Now, only 20
            years later, the industry has gained solid ground and is already
            dramatically shifting our agricultural practices and the future of
            our food system.
